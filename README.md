# About
This project aims to create recursive fractals using C++ and the openFrameworks library. A fractal is a geometric figure that is repeated at different scales and at different angles, creating complex and beautiful patterns.

In this repository, you will find several examples of fractals that you can generate using the provided code. The implemented fractals are the "Fractal Tree", the "Dragon's Curve" and the "Sierpinski Triangle". In addition, the codes are designed to allow you to customize the fractals' parameters, such as recursion depth, size, and orientation.

This project is a great opportunity to learn about programming, math, and fractal geometry in C++. If you are a beginner, you can start with the "sierpinski_triangle.cpp" code and play with the parameters to create different variations of the Sierpinski Triangle. If you are an advanced user, you can try creating your own fractals or even combining different fractals to create even more interesting patterns.
